Refactoring is an important and effective activity to optimize the source code in a well manner. It makes a code easier to understand and improves the quality and app’s architecture. The complexity of this project has been reduced after applying the refactoring and improving the quality of the food service marketplace product. By means of optimization we reduced the maintenance cost because the complexity of software has been decreased, though the core functionality has been significantly extended.
